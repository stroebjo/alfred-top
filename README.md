Processes in Alfred
===================

This workflow for [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) allows you to search through the running processes on your machine sorted by CPU utilization (like [top](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_(software))).

The `cmd`-Key modifier allows to kill a process.

Installation
------------

Just [download the Workflow here](https://github.com/stroebjo/alfred-top/releases) and open it.
